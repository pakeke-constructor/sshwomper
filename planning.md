# Planning:


Put commandline output on the bottom.
User should be able to type any commands they want.
(Also, the command-history should be shown)


Left-navbar:
- Files (make sure to refresh automatically after commands, and periodically!!!)
    (^^^ we should also look at preloading for faster navigation)
- Processes (use `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 15`, refresh every 5 seconds)
- Auth (Show/Edit authorized ssh users)
- Favorites


ssh sessions should be saved (use `pip install appdirs`)
save to a json file or somthn
